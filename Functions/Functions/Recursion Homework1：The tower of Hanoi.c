////The tower of Hanoi:
////Description: The problem of tower of Hanoi is about 7 different size of circles on
////three different pillars.
////Let's assume three pillars are A B C, and 7 different circuls are I, II, III, IV, V
////V, VI, VII£¬the the VII one is the biggest, I one is the smallest.
////At first the seven circles is on the pillar A, the problem is that you have to move
////all seven circles to the pillar C, and everytime you move, an rule is that the bigger
////circle is always below smaller ones.
////
////Write a code to make this happen:
//#include <stdio.h>
//void Move()
//{
//
//}
//int main()
//{
//	int arrA[] = { 1,2,3,4 };
//	int arrB[3] = { 0 };
//	int arrC[3] = { 0 };
//	
//	return 0;
//}
